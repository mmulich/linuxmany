# The Many Linux Project on Debian

## Project Description

This is a port of the [Many Linux Project](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) on Debian instead of CentOS. The goal is the same as the Many Linxu Project plus the ability to maintain the setup.

I am not highly familiar with RPM-based systems and don't really care to be. I am fairly familiar with APT-based systems though. My preference would be to utilize the concept of the Many Linux Project overtop of something I can extend and maintain.
